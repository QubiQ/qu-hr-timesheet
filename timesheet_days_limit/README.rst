====================
Timesheet Days Limit
====================

This module extends the functionality of the timesheets in order to be able to control employee imputations with an assignable time margin.


Installation
============

Only install this module.


Configuration
=============

Is not necessary do any action.


Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to employees and enter any employee.  
#. Click the check button called *Check day of the time sheet* in the tab of work information of the employee.
#. Enter a number of days for the limit time in the text called *Remaining days*.

Then, when the employee imputate his hours of work, the imputation day will be verified if the check button is on. If the employee pass his limit time entered in the time limit text, he won't be able to impute his work hours. This forces the employee to impute his hours when it should be done.
